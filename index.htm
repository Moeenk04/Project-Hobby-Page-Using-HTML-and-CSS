            <h2>Basic Rules of Cricket</h2>
            <p>Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective is for one team to
                score more runs than the other. A match consists of two innings, with one team batting while the other
                team bowls and fields. Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while
                bowlers aim to dismiss batsmen by hitting the stumps or inducing mistakes. Runs can also be scored
                through boundaries, such as fours and sixes. Batsmen can be dismissed in various ways, including being
                bowled, caught, or run out. Extras are runs scored by the batting team that are not attributed to the
                batsmen. Matches are divided into overs, with each over consisting of six deliveries bowled by the same
                bowler. These basic rules govern the gameplay of cricket, a sport rich in tradition and strategy.</p>

            <ol>
            <li><h3>Bat:</h3></li>
            <p>The cricket bat is used by the batsman to hit the ball bowled by the opposing team's bowler. Bats come in
                various shapes and sizes, but they typically have a flat wooden blade attached to a handle.</p>

            <p>TThe cricket bat is used by the batsman to hit the ball bowled by the opposing team's bowler. Bats come
                in various shapes and sizes, but they typically have a flat wooden blade attached to a handle.</p>
                <li><h3>stumps:</h3></li>
            <p>Stumps are three vertical wooden posts that are hammered into the ground at each end of the pitch. They
                consist of two bails placed on top of the stumps. The stumps are used to determine if a batsman has been
                dismissed.</p>
                <li><h3>Helmet:</h3></li>
            <p>A helmet is worn by the batsman to protect their head from injury. It consists of a hard outer shell and
                padding on the inside to absorb impact from the ball.</p>
                <li><h3>Pads:</h3></li>
            <p>Pads, also known as leg guards or shin guards, are worn by the batsman to protect their legs from injury.
                They consist of padded panels that cover the lower part of the legs, including the knees and shins.</p>
                <li><h3>Gloves:</h3></li>
            <p>Batting gloves are worn by the batsman to protect their hands and improve grip on the bat. They typically
                have padded palms and fingers to absorb impact from the ball.</p>
                <li><h3>Thigh Guard:</h3></li>
            <p>A thigh guard is worn by the batsman to protect the upper thigh area from injury. It is usually made of
                padded material and is worn under the trousers.</p>
                <li><h3>Box (Abdominal Guard):</h3></li>
            <p> A box, also known as an abdominal guard or protector, is worn by the batsman to protect the groin area
                from injury. It is a rigid plastic or metal cup that is worn inside the trousers.</p>
                <li><h3>Fielding Equipment:</h3></li>
            <p>Fielders may use equipment such as fielding gloves, helmets, and shin guards to protect themselves while
                fielding close to the batsman or in positions where they are likely to face hard-hit balls.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Tape ball cricket is my absolute favorite! It's a variation of cricket where we use a tennis ball
                wrapped in tape instead of the traditional hard cricket ball. It's more informal and often played in
                smaller spaces like streets or backyards. The tape ball bounces differently and swings more
                unpredictably, which adds a whole new level of excitement to the game. I love the fast-paced action and
                the challenge of adapting to the ball's movement. I've also had the chance to play a bit of hard ball
                cricket, which is more formal and played with a heavier, harder ball. While it's a bit different, both
                versions of cricket are incredibly fun and have taught me a lot about teamwork and strategy.</p>
